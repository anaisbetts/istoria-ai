very good idea - start to store all of our text-based information (notes, slack logs, etc) in one place, then write parsers / renderers to write out versions that can be put into notebooklm / claude / etc. Effectively what you're doing with notes + powershell, but with *everything*.  

for now let's just get it replacing the powershell script

sources of data (order of usefulness):

- notes / pages obvs
- slack chats
- daylio
- social media exports
- photo metadata + ai descriptions
- claude export
- even old aim chats
- last.fm
